# AnimalSanctuaryProject


## Description 
In this program, users "visit" an Animal Sanctuary and use a menu to choose from 4 different options to complete various actions. The first option is to view a list of the current animals in the sanctuary, as well as any vacant enclosures. The second option allows the user to add an animal to a vacant enclosure using a preselected animal list (ex. frog, gecko, crocodile) and name the new animal. The third option, the user can have the sanctuary attendant feed the animals. While the attendant feeds the animals, the user can see what noises the animals make, what type of food they eat and the amound of food they are being fed. Once the user is ready to end the experience, they can exit sanctuary by choosing the last option.

## Lessons Learned
I struggled a lot with this project but I'm learned a lot in my failures! I definitely need to decidate more time to reviewing and getting more outside examples and resources to ensure I really understand the concepts. I'm understanding inheritance more, getting more familiar with calling methods from other classes, reading UMLs, and getting more comfortable with loops (atleast with while and do while loops). On the other hand, arrays are still a big struggle for me, booleans and even objects/instances can tricky. One of the grading requirements was not to construct an Animal class instance when the user added an animal to the sanctuary and I found it very difficult to find a way around that. This project also really cemented the imporantance and usefulness of using various methods for different logic and not trying to cram all your logic into one method.
